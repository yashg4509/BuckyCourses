## What do you mean by "headless" ?

Instead of being limited to a set of pre-styled components, **refine** provides collections of helper `hooks`, `components`, `providers`, and more. Since business logic and the UI are completely decoupled, you can customize the UI without constraints.

It means that **refine** just works _seamlessly_ with any _custom designs_ or _UI frameworks_. Thanks to it's headless architecture, you can use popular CSS frameworks like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or even create your own styles from scratch.

refine also provides integrations with [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) to get you started quickly. These libraries are a set of components that are nicely integrated with the headless `@refinedev/core` package.

## How it works?

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Upload your DARS
The first step is to upload your DARS. We need your DARS so that our model can understand your interests and the courses you have already taken.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Instantly Generate Your Perfect Four-Year Plan
Our cutting edge machine learning algorithm processes courses you have already taken, major requirements, average GPA data, and more. Like an advisor, BuckyCourses lets you answer any questions you have regarding coursework, how you can fulfill your requirements, information on certain courses, and recommends courses that align with your interests. All so you can make the most personalized and adaptable four year plan without stress!

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Fine-Tune Your Plan with Ease
Not satisfied with your initial plan? No problem! Tweak your schedule in real-time to explore different elective combinations, adjust your GPA goals, or even find the best balance between work and play.

## Understanding our Model


- **Data Integration**: BuckyCourses utilizes a Pandas Dataframe Agent to process and integrate data from various datasets, including course information, major requirements, and average GPA data.

- **User Interface**: The user interface is deployed using Chainlit, providing a user-friendly platform to interact with the tool and access the wealth of information it offers.

- **Fine-tuning**: The model is fine-tuned using multiple datasets to optimize its performance for academic advising and course recommendations.

- **DAR Scraping Algorithm**: BuckyCourses includes a DAR scraping algorithm that extracts course information from Degree Audit Reports (DARs) in PDF format. This is crucial for personalized academic planning.

- **GPA Data and Course Information Scraping**: BuckyCourses scrapes average GPA data from Madgrades and collects course information from the University of Wisconsin-Madison guide (guide.wisc.edu) to provide insights into course performance and difficulty.
